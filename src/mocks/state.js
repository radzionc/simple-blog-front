My thoughts were always intertwined. The process of falling asleep become longer. At morning I was fighting with myself to wake up, but lose this battle most of the time. It was a hard time: work, university, and Increaser took all my time. In one of those evenings, I decided to take a walk. I went to the stadium near my home and began to pass a circle after a circle. While walking, I think about each of my activity separately from others. After that walk, I fell asleep without chaotic thinking in the head.","marks":[]}]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"","marks":[]}]}]},{"object":"block","type":"paragraph","data":{},"nodes":[{"object":"text","leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"From that evening I started practicing it every evening.

By doing rethinking about the day — I free myself from thinking about my problems and actions during the day. Since I don’t need to bother myself — I will analyze them at evening anyway.
